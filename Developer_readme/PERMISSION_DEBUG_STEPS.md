# PERMISSION DEBUGGING STEPS

## Current Status
- ✅ Firestore rules deployed with `allow read, write: if true` (extremely permissive)
- ✅ Firebase project `arti-a4734` is active
- ✅ Google Sign-in working (user gets authenticated)
- ❌ Still getting `PERMISSION_DENIED` when writing to Firestore

## What to Test Now:

### 1. **Try Google Sign-in Again**
With the new extremely permissive rules (`allow read, write: if true`), try the Google Sign-in process again. The permission error should be completely gone.

### 2. **If Still Getting Permission Error**
This means the issue is NOT with Firestore rules but with:
- Database region mismatch
- Authentication token not being passed correctly
- Network/connectivity issues
- App cache issues

### 3. **Clear App Cache**
If the error persists, clear the app data and try again:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
# Rebuild and test
```

### 4. **Check Auth Token**
Add this debug code to verify auth token is working:
```dart
// In your app, add this debug check
User? user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
if (user != null) {
  String? token = await user.getIdToken();
  print("Auth token exists: ${token != null}");
  print("User UID: ${user.uid}");
  print("User email: ${user.email}");
} else {
  print("No authenticated user found");
}
```

### 5. **Manual Test**
Try creating a simple document manually to test:
```dart
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('test')
    .doc('test-doc')
    .set({'message': 'hello world', 'timestamp': DateTime.now()});
```

## Expected Result
With rules set to `allow read, write: if true`, ANY write operation should succeed, regardless of authentication status.

If it still fails, the issue is with the Firebase project setup or network connectivity, not permissions.
