# Artisan Workshop Customization System

## 🎯 Solution Overview

**Problem Resolved**: Automatic generation of random Unsplash images that don't represent the artisan's actual work.

**Solution**: Complete artisan workshop customization system allowing sellers to:
- ✅ Edit all workshop text content
- ✅ Upload their own authentic workshop images
- ✅ Provide guided image requirements for each chapter
- ✅ Preview and publish customized workshops

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. **Modified AI Generation** (`vertex_ai_service.dart`)
- **Removed**: Automatic image generation using Vertex AI Imagen or Unsplash
- **Added**: Image placeholder system with upload requirements
- **Enhanced**: Guidelines for each chapter based on emotional theme

```dart
// NEW: Prepares workshop for artisan customization
chapter['generated_image_url'] = null; // No auto-generated images
chapter['artisan_image_url'] = null;   // Placeholder for artisan upload
chapter['upload_required'] = true;     // Flag for artisan to upload
chapter['image_guidelines'] = _getImageGuidelines(chapter['emotion']);
```

### 2. **Artisan Customization Service** (`artisan_workshop_customization_service.dart`)
Comprehensive service handling:
- ✅ Text content updates (titles, descriptions, stories)
- ✅ Image uploads with Firebase Storage integration
- ✅ Workshop ownership verification
- ✅ Completion validation before publishing
- ✅ Progress tracking

### 3. **Workshop Editor UI** (`artisan_workshop_editor.dart`)
User-friendly interface providing:
- ✅ Text editing for all workshop content
- ✅ Chapter-by-chapter image upload with guidelines
- ✅ Progress tracking and completion status
- ✅ Publish workflow with validation

## 📝 Workshop Customization Flow

### Step 1: AI Generation
1. AI generates workshop structure and text content
2. Creates image placeholders with specific guidelines
3. Marks workshop as `customization_required: true`
4. Status: `pending_images_and_text`

### Step 2: Artisan Customization
1. Artisan edits workshop text content
2. Uploads authentic images for each chapter
3. Receives specific guidelines for each image type
4. Tracks completion progress

### Step 3: Publishing
1. System validates all required content is present
2. Artisan reviews and publishes workshop
3. Status changes to `completed` and `published`
4. Workshop becomes available to customers

## 🎨 Image Guidelines System

Each chapter receives specific upload guidelines based on emotional theme:

### Chapter Emotions & Guidelines

**Anticipation**: "Upload an image showing the beginning of your craft process - workspace setup, tools ready, or materials prepared. Capture the excitement of starting something new."

**Flow**: "Show yourself in action during your craft. Capture the focused concentration and skilled hand movements that demonstrate your expertise."

**Wonder**: "Highlight the magical transformation moment - raw materials becoming something beautiful. Show the 'before and after' or work in progress."

**Pride**: "Display a nearly finished piece that showcases your unique style and craftsmanship. Show what makes your work special and distinctive."

**Fulfillment**: "Present your completed masterpiece in its full glory. This should be your best work that represents your skill and artistry."
